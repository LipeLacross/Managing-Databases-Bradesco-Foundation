# Course: Database Administration - Funda√ß√£o Bradesco

This repository contains the files and materials used in the **Database Administration** course from Funda√ß√£o Bradesco. The course covers the creation, management, backup, and maintenance of databases using SQL Server. Practical examples include database creation, data import and export, as well as backup and recovery operations.

## üî® Course Features

- The course demonstrates SQL Server operations, including creating and managing a fictional database for a movie rental business.
- Data is structured in several tables (clients, movies, orders, etc.), with examples of importing data from Excel and performing backup and recovery operations.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and Technologies Used
- **SQL Server**: For database creation and management.
- **SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)**: For administrative operations on the database.
- **T-SQL**: SQL language used for database manipulation.
- **Excel**: For importing data into tables.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Performing full and differential backups using SSMS.

## üìÅ Project Structure
- **Archives/**
    - `LOCADORA_DADOS.mdf`: SQL Server database data file.
    - `LOCADORA_LOG.ldf`: SQL Server transaction log file.
    - `tbl_clientes.xls`: Excel file for the clients table.
    - `tbl_clientes.zip`: Compressed version of the clients table.
    - `tbl_detalhesdopedido.xls`: Excel file for order details.
    - `tbl_detalhesdopedido.zip`: Compressed version of the order details table.
    - `tbl_filmes.xls`: Excel file for movies table.
    - `tbl_filmes.zip`: Compressed version of the movies table.
    - `tbl_genero.xls`: Excel file for movie genres table.
    - `tbl_genero.zip`: Compressed version of the genres table.
    - `tbl_pedidos.xls`: Excel file for orders table.
    - `tbl_pedidos.zip`: Compressed version of the orders table.

- **Documentation/**
    - `adm_bd - Database Administration.pdf`: Course manual.
    - `tela_*.pdf`: Detailed guides for SQL Server operations, such as backup, data import, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Project Locally

To start working with the database, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure that SQL Server and SSMS are installed**:
    - You need [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) to run the database locally.
    - [SSMS](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup) should be used to manage the database.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Copy the repository URL and run the command below in your terminal:

      ```bash
      git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
      ```

3. **Import the Database**:
    - In SSMS, connect to your SQL server.
    - Attach the `LOCADORA_DADOS.mdf` data file and the `LOCADORA_LOG.ldf` log file.

4. **Import Tables**:
    - Use the Excel files to import data into the tables via SSMS or T-SQL commands as outlined in the course tutorials.

5. **Backup Operations**:
    - Follow the instructions from the course to perform full and differential backups using SSMS.

## üåê Deploy

To deploy in a production environment, you can use the backup and recovery methods taught during the course. Deployment involves migrating the database to a production server and configuring automatic backups, monitoring, and periodic maintenance.
